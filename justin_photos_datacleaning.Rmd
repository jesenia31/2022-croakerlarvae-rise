The odd rows represent measurements from the lateral side of the fish, and the even rows represent measurements from the dorsal side of the fish
```{r}
atlantic_croaker_2017_Jmeasurements <- read_csv("~/Documents/OneDrive - aguadilla.inter.edu/BS Microbiology Inter/Internship and opportunities/RISE Internship/2022-croakerlarvae-rise/data/atlantic_croaker_2017_Jmeasurements.csv")
